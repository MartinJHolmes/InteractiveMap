            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                After breakfast (remember to bring something) we will take the No. 95 bus from the City of Science and Arts to the Old Town.
                There you'll get a glimpse of some of the Muslim walls.
            </p>
            <p>
                From there we will walk to Torres de Sarrano and then along the Turia River.
                Please remember to bring strong shoes, it is a long walk.
                After arriving at the Port of Valencia you'll be exhausted and ready to return to your hostels for the night.
