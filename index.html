            <h2>Originals</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>Foundation by the Romans (138 BCE)</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
                The city was founded as a Roman colony in 138 BCE under the name Valentia Edetanorum.
                It was established for Roman soldiers who had fought in the wars against Lusitanian tribes under
                Viriatus.
                The name Valentia meant "strength" or "valor."
            </p>
            <div>
                <h3>Islamic period (8th-13th century):</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
                In 714 CE, Muslim forces took Valencia.
                Under Moorish rule, the city (known as Balansiya) flourished as a hub of agriculture, trade, and
                learning.
                The fertile lands around Valencia were transformed by advanced irrigation systems, canals, and the
                introduction of new crops such as rice, citrus, and silk production.
            </p>
            <div>
                <h3>Christian reconquest (1238):</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
                In 1238, King James I of Aragon (Jaume I) captured Valencia, integrating it into the Crown of Aragon.
                He repopulated it with Christian settlers and granted it its own legal code, the Furs of Valencia.
                This marked the beginning of Valencia's rise as a major Mediterranean city.
